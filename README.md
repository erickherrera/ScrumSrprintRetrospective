CS 250 - FinalAssignment

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are interpreted into user stories as part of the Scrum framework, and this is a tool that helps the development team organize the deliverables. If the user stories received by the product owner feel too broad, the development team along with the Scrum master can ask more probing question so that the product owner further dissects the user needs into user stories.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  For the most part I approach developing simialr to waterfall mostlry because I dont usually program with others. If I am working with other I do think that using the Scrum framework is going to help building a program that is constantly being tested before its merged. Also having clear roles and responsibilities implemented by the scrum framework really helps the team work cohesively and harmonously reducing the probability for bugs and defects.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member is someone that fully understand their role and responsibilities, and if they are not clear or lose alignment they make sure to voice that concern. They will always communicate any delays, and any time something is ready to be tested. A good team member is someone that offers to test things for other.
